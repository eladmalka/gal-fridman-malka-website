Update the existing project with the following UI/UX + Admin + WhatsApp + Form requirements. Implement everything end-to-end.

1) Centering & layout polish (Hebrew RTL)
- Center-align ALL texts across the landing page where it looks best:
  - Hero title/subtitle/CTAs centered
  - Section titles centered
  - Paragraph blocks centered (but keep max-width so it stays readable)
- Center all logos / brand marks / icons (if any), including in the header/hero.
- Keep a premium, clean composition: consistent spacing, max-width containers, and balanced vertical rhythm.
- Keep the antique pink / dusty rose design language, rounded corners, subtle shadows, calm typography.

2) Lead Form layout
- Center the entire lead form section:
  - The form card itself should be centered horizontally on the page
  - Inputs aligned RTL, but the whole block centered
  - Clear success/error states, still centered
- Keep the CTA hierarchy clear and visually appealing.

3) Admin Image Manager: EVERY image must be replaceable
- I want an option to replace EVERY image that exists anywhere on the landing page.
- Implement a strict “image slots” registry:
  - Define a slot key for each image used in the UI (no exceptions).
  - Examples (adjust to match the actual UI):
    - HEADER_LOGO
    - HERO_IMAGE (or HERO_BACKGROUND)
    - HERO_BADGE_ICON (if used)
    - PROFILE_IMAGE (About section)
    - SERVICES_IMAGE_1 / SERVICES_IMAGE_2 / SERVICES_IMAGE_3 (if there are images in service cards)
    - GALLERY_1..GALLERY_N
    - FOOTER_LOGO (if used)
    - Any decorative/background images that appear in sections
- Admin page /admin must show ALL slot keys automatically (driven by the registry), with:
  - Current thumbnail
  - “Replace” button (upload)
  - “Remove / revert to placeholder”
  - Edit alt text (Hebrew) + optional caption (Hebrew)
  - If gallery exists: reorder via drag & drop
- Landing page must render images strictly by slot keys so changing a slot updates immediately.

4) WhatsApp prefilled message changes
- Remove the parts that ask for the user’s name and callback phone from the WhatsApp auto-message.
- New prefilled Hebrew message (URL-encode it and use it in the WhatsApp link):
  "היי גל, אשמח לשיחת היכרות קצרה לגבי נומרולוגיה בשילוב אימון זוגי."
- Keep the WhatsApp phone number as previously defined:
  0523491792 -> international: +972523491792

5) Lead Form destination email
- The lead form must send directly to this email (hard requirement):
  galfridman21@gmail.com
- Use server-side email sending (SMTP/Nodemailer or provider).
- Make sure form submission emails include:
  - timestamp
  - all form fields
  - page/source identifier (e.g., “Landing Page Lead”)

6) Reliability + safety
- Do not break if integrations are missing:
  - If SMTP not configured, show clear admin/server warnings but keep UI functional.
- Keep anti-spam measures (honeypot + rate limit).

Now implement all these changes in the code:
- Centered typography/layout updates
- Centered lead form block
- Complete slot-based admin image replacement for every landing page image
- Updated WhatsApp prefilled message (short version only)
- Lead form email goes to galfridman21@gmail.com
Provide updated file structure and clear setup instructions.
