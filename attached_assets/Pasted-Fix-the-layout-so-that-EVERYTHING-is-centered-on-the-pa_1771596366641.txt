Fix the layout so that EVERYTHING is centered on the page. This is a hard requirement.

Global Centering Rules (Hebrew RTL):
1) Set a global page layout wrapper that centers all content horizontally:
   - Use a single main container with:
     - display: flex
     - flex-direction: column
     - align-items: center
   - Apply it to the entire site (header, main, sections, footer, admin pages too if applicable).

2) Text centering:
   - All headings, paragraphs, labels, helper texts, buttons, and section titles must be center-aligned:
     - text-align: center everywhere by default
   - Hebrew RTL must remain correct:
     - direction: rtl
     - unicode-bidi: plaintext (or equivalent safe handling)

3) Centering inside sections:
   - Every section must be centered and constrained for readability:
     - Use max-width (e.g., 980px or 1100px) and center it
     - Even within cards/grids, the whole group must be centered
   - If you use a grid (services/testimonials/gallery), the grid itself must be centered with:
     - justify-items: center
     - place-items: center (when relevant)
   - Cards should be centered and their content centered.

4) Forms must be fully centered:
   - The entire form card centered
   - Each input centered within the form layout (while keeping RTL text input)
   - Buttons centered
   - Validation and success messages centered

5) Header / footer / logos:
   - Center the logo
   - Center nav links (if any)
   - Center all footer content and contact links

6) Gallery/images:
   - Center the gallery container
   - Center each image tile and any captions
   - Ensure images keep nice proportions and don’t overflow

7) Spacing & responsiveness:
   - Centering must work perfectly on mobile and desktop
   - Avoid awkward full-width text blocks; keep consistent padding and max widths
   - Ensure no element is “left-aligned” or “stuck to the side” anywhere

Implementation Notes:
- Use Tailwind or CSS consistently (don’t mix randomly).
- Provide a single “Layout” component or global CSS that enforces this everywhere.
- After implementing, verify by scanning all major components and sections:
  Header, Hero, Trust, Services, Benefits, Gallery, Form, Footer, Admin (/admin), and confirm center alignment in each.

GitHub requirement (NEW repo, do not overwrite anything):
- I want you to push this project to my GitHub as a BRAND NEW repository (a new project), without overwriting any existing repositories.
- Steps required:
  1) Initialize a new local git repository inside the project folder (git init).
  2) Create a new repository on GitHub with a NEW unique name (do NOT reuse an existing repo name).
  3) Add the GitHub repo as origin and push the initial commit to the default branch.
  4) Provide the exact commands for Windows PowerShell.
- IMPORTANT:
  - Do not force-push to any existing repo.
  - Do not reuse an existing remote URL.
  - Ensure the new repo name is unique and clearly related (e.g., "gal-friedman-numerology-landing" or similar).
  - Include a proper .gitignore (node_modules, .env, dist/.next, uploads if needed) and ensure .env is NOT committed.

Deliverable:
- Update the code so ALL elements across the entire landing page are centered visually and textually.
- Provide the updated layout wrapper code and mention where it is applied.
- Provide the full Git steps + commands to publish this as a new repo without overwriting anything.
